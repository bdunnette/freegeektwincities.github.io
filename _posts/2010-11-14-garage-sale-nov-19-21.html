The Free Geek Twin Cities Garage Sale is coming!
<ul>
	<li>Friday, Nov. 19, 4pm-8pm</li>
	<li>Saturday, Nov. 20, noon-5pm</li>
	<li>Sunday, Nov. 21, 1pm-5pm</li>
</ul>
We will have complete computer systems starting at $40, which includes a monitor (CRT). These refurbished computers are built by our own volunteers. Flat screen monitors will also be available as an upgrade for a modest fee. There will also be Macintoshes for sale, along with printers, mice, scanners, and various other computer components and accessories. All PCs come with Ubuntu Linux already installed and ready to go. And if you are unfamiliar with Ubuntu, we will be offering an introductory class on it in just a few weeks, free with any computer purchase. All proceeds go to supporting Free Geek Twin Cities and our mission of bridging the digital divide and responsible recycling.

We spent this past weekend mostly testing the flat screen LCD monitors we plan to sell to make sure everything is in working order. We also finished selecting the Geek Boxes that we will sell in the garage sale.

So, come to the garage sale and see what we've got. Better still, bring a computer to donate and stay and become a volunteer. We always have room for more of both. See you there!
