The physical process of moving is done, thank you to all those who showed up to help move, sort, and start to set up the new space.

We still have much work to do, and our normal processes of testing and building are still not ready to start, but we will work on getting those back up by the end of May.

Stop on down to visit the new space, if you have time help us get back up and running, drop off those odd electronics and tell everybody you know about us.

Remember that if you come to volunteer, wear comfortable clothing that may get dirty.
