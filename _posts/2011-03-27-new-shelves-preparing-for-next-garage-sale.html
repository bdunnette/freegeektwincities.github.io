We got some new shelves built this week, sorely needed. The 'hose room', where hoses were hung to dry back when the building was a fire station, is where we have been storing build-machines that are complete as well as in-progress. This isn't a good arrangement because it's not always clear which category a machine is in, and the room was getting crowded. On Saturday we started giving completed machines one last check to verify that they're ready to be distributed, and then moved them to a new home on the new shelves.

We are tentatively planning to have another garage sale in early May. In the coming weeks, we'll be filling up the new shelves with completed machines, flatscreen monitors, and other computer parts that will be available for purchase at the garage sale. We're still working on the exact date(s). Check back here for details.

Meanwhile, our recycling process is really becoming a well-oiled machine. We've got the routines down of breaking down the old computers &amp; printers to their components, sorting those components into boxes, and segregating the boxes by which recycling partner they need to go to. We used to only sporadically deliver materials to the recyclers; now it's becoming almost a monthly activity. For now we are relying on volunteers to delivers the parts to recyclers. Since we make a bit of money from the materials, we may eventually be able to pay to have them picked up.
