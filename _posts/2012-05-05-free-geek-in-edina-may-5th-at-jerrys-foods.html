Once again we have a remote pick up scheduled at Jerry's Foods in Edina, last year we had a significant collection of equipment and weather permitting we hope to again gather significant quantities of gear that might end up in a landfill otherwise.

We hope to have a couple more over the summer as well, so watch the website to keep updated.
