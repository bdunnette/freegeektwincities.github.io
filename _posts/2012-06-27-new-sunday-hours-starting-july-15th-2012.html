Starting Sunday July 15th, we are going to be moving our open hours up to Noon and close at 5pm like every other day we are open.

Our staff Volunteer has had reason to change our hours on Sundays to open and close two hours earlier, so Starting the 15 these will be the hours.

So that means the Free Geek Thrift Store is open Wed through Sunday Noon to 5, and Volunteer hours are now Noon to 5 Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday.

Please plan your schedule accordingly.
