Some kids from the neighborhood often stop by and ask if I will serve as their supervising adult so they can volunteer. If I am not too busy I will put them to work.
Rup told me he wanted to learn how to create a website - for free. Within an hour he had created this <strong><a title="Nepali Comedy Free Website" href="http://nepalicomdedy.wordpress.com/hindi-movie/">Nepalicomedy site</a></strong> with embedded videos from YouTube, a custom header background image, custom navigation menu, 4 static pages, and a blog landing page.
