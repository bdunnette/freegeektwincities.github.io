On August 1 we had our first pickup of recyclable materials at our new location. Waste Management/Recycle America sent a truck which took away seven pallets of plastic, CRTS, hard drives (all spiked!), circuit boards, and various other sorted components. We just got the report back from WM/RA and the grand total was 1976 pounds! That's right, we shipped almost a ton of recycling, keeping a whole bunch of toxins and precious metals out of landfills.

Our last shipment had been in April, in preparation for the garage sale and the move. Considering that we didn't do any recycling work in May because of those events, nor for a week or two after the move while we settled in, it appears we generate a ton of recycling about every twelve weeks. Plus, we recovered enough valuable materials in the process to not only pay for the truck to come pickup the materials (in the past we've hauled it ourselves), but even had a bit of credit left over.

Having the space for pallets and gaylord boxes has been a godsend. Without it, we wouldn't have been able to scale up our recycling as we have. We really are moving along now.

If you haven't seen our new site, come visit us, and we'll show you our great new recycling area, where we are making "a ton" of difference.
