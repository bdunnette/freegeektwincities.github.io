Welcome to our new blog section of the Free Geek TC website. We hope to keep you up-to-date on changes happening at our space. Here goes!

Due to having a dearth of monitor donations, we're having a give-away! That's right. Stop by on Saturday and you can pick up a free CRT monitor. As supplies last!
