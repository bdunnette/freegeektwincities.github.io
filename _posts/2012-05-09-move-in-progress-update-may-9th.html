We have a majority of the items moved, and would like to thanks all the volunteers who have turned out to help us lift, lug and transport items to the new space.   There is still moving to be done, and then we need to set up the space to get back into the flow of things.   First we will focus on getting our recycling back up to speed, there is a back log of items already, so we hope to have that aspect working in the new space by the end of this weekend, then we will work on getting testing back up and working, and lastly our build process should be up and working by the 19th or so.    Plus we have a new space to set up our thrift store.

So stop in during our normal hours this weekend and help get things back up to speed, we cannot do this without our volunteers.
