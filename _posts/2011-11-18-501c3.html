It's official! Last week we received a letter from the IRS stating that Free Geek Twin Cities is now a formally recognized 501c3 non-profit charity. This means that donations to FGTC are tax-deductible. Since we received the certification in 2011, any donations made this year can be deducted, not just those made going forward. This certification will enable us to work with businesses and other groups that might not otherwise donate their old computers to us if we weren't a "formal" non-profit.

So, come <a title="Donations" href="http://freegeektwincities.org/about-2/donations/">donate your old computer</a> or money to Free Geek Twin Cities and take a deduction. Better yet, come <a title="Volunteer" href="http://freegeektwincities.org/volunteer-2/">donate your time</a> with us and help us help the needy get nerdy.
