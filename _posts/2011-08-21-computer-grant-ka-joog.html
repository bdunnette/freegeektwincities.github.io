<a href="http://www.kajoog.org/">Ka Joog</a> is a local Somali organization in our neighborhood. The non-profit <em>"exists for the sole purpose of our youth. We are committed to motivate our youth to attain a higher education, to realize their potential and to achieve their dreams."</em> This week we donated five computers and a network switch through our Grant Program to Ka Joog to help them in their efforts.

Ka Joog will use the computers in their youth community center which they've built as place for high school and college kids to hang out, providing a safe, positive atmosphere.

Meanwhile, our recycle, test, and build operations are in full swing.

In fact, we've gotten to be such a well-oiled-machine in our ability to receive, dismantle, test, and rebuild computers that we are actually running a bit low on fodder for our pipeline. So, we need YOU to dig that old computer out of the closet and bring it to Free Geek where we'll put it to good use teaching people about computers and helping groups like Ka Joog build a stronger community.
