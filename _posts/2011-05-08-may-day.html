We had a table again this year in Powderhorn Park where the May Day Parade reaches its climax. Various staff members took turns manning the table, telling passers-by about what we do at Free Geek. The weather was a bit brisk, but so was the interest in Free Geek. We gave out all the flyers we had printed.
