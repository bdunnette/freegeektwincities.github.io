Last week we moved all our stuff to our new location. This week we put the banner up, and started unpacking everything and figuring out where to put it. While we had taken great care in placing "materials for building computers" and "materials to be recycled" into separate boxes when we were packing, all those boxes ended up in one big pile at the new place (see the previous blog entry). We assembled much of the shelving previously donated and used that to sort out the big pile.

One of our favorite features of this new space is the front desk. It gives us an actual vehicle for greeting visitors and volunteers, taking donations, minding the thrift shop, and acting as the "ship's bridge" for the day's activities.

We even had a few donations come in today, along with some new volunteers.

We must give a special thanks to Megan &amp; Sophie for making floorplan that is actually to proper scale. We're using it to plan out where we want to put things, where we want to have things like classes, building, teardown, and so forth.

There is still a lot of work to be done, unboxing, unpacking, finding homes for things. But we got much of that done today, and we may be able to resume at least tearing down computers &amp; printers for recycling next week. It will probably be another week before we can resume the Build program as we are still working on identifying and unpacking all of our "known good" components.

Nevertheless, all are welcome, so come pay us a visit and check out our new home. There's always plenty of free parking.
