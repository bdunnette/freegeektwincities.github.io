Kitty, one of our regular volunteers, lives in Edina. As part of the <a href="http://edinadayofservice.org/">Edina Day of Service</a>, she organized a "Donate your old computer to Free Geek Twin Cities" dropoff in the parking lot of <a href="http://www.jerrysfoods.com/">Jerry's Foods</a>supermarket. The weather was perfect, but we had no idea if anyone would show up. Well, the good folks of Edina really came through for us. We received over 50 desktop machines, more than 20 laptops, and about 20 flatscreens. We filled two minivans and an SUV with all the donations. A hearty thanks to Kitty and the people of Edina.
