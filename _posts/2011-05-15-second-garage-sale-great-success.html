We had our second garage sale on May 6-8 and it was a great success, bringing over $1000 into our coffers.

We'd spent the weeks leading up to it prepping extra machines from our Build Program, testing monitors, and so forth. Sunday was rather quiet, because it was Mother's Day and because it was cold &amp; rainy, but even on that day we sold a few computers and monitors.

In the previous garage sale in November we had a wider selection of peripherals and other electronic equipment. This time we narrowed the focus to mostly computers, monitors, and printers because while preparing for the garage sale, we were also preparing to move.
