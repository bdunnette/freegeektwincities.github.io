The new digs are shaping up thanks to many hands and the carry over from the old location.    The basic layout has been chosen and we are working towards getting everything back up and running, while still trying to accept new volunteers and process donations.

Also the store is starting to take shape, all while we try to unpack the store in to temporary areas.

&nbsp;

We also have heard from several student volunteers who hope to spend time down at Free Geek this summer to help grow and expand our organization.

So stop on down during a Wednesday, Saturday or Sunday and check out the new digs, help clean up the remains from the move, or set up an area or just take apart some of the recycle stock.
