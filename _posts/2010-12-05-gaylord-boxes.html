This week we got some gaylord boxes from <a href="http://www.recycleamerica.com/">Waste Management</a>. We filled nearly four of these huge boxes with all the CRT monitors that used to make up our "Monitor Mountain". We began filling a fifth box with all the plastic parts we have accumulated in the past several months of computer &amp; printer teardown. Next week, WM will send a truck to pick these all up for recycling. (WM is a <a href="http://www.ban.org/">BAN</a>-approved<a href="http://e-stewards.org/find-a-recycler/qualified-pledged-recyclers/">e-steward recycler</a>.)

We also took 200 pounds of wire and cables to <a href="http://www.lederbros.com/">Leder Brothers Metal Recycling</a>. This was our first visit to Leder Bros. When we told them about Free Geek, they seemed very interested in having an on-going relationship with us, both as a place to direct people with old computers and as a resource for them to send their own computers. Leder Bros. is only about a mile away and they are open Saturday mornings, which makes it convenient for us.
