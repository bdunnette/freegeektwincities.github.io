Free Geek Twin Cities (FGTC) is dedicated to addressing the following issues though direct, local, community-driven action:
<ul>
	<li>The Digital Divide</li>
	<li>Electronic Waste (eWaste)</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Digital Divide and Education</h3>
There are still many people in our community that do not have access to computers and the Internet, or do not possess the skills to adequately leverage these technologies. There are many reasons for this gap in our population, but one of our main goals is alleviate this problem through work and education. <a title="Volunteers" href="http://freegeektwincities.dreamhosters.com/volunteer-2/">Volunteers</a> work in programs where they gain skills on how to use, build, and understand computers, and in the process <a title="Adoption" href="http://freegeektwincities.dreamhosters.com/volunteer-2/adoption/">earn a free computer</a>.
<h3>Electronic Waste and Reuse</h3>
With the rapid growth of technology, our community has created large quantities of electronic waste. FGTC accepts this waste and its first goal is to <a title="Reuse" href="http://freegeektwincities.dreamhosters.com/about-2/reuse/">reuse</a> this material and refurbish it into a new computer to give to volunteers or to sell in our thrift store. It is not always possible to reuse all the materials we get, so we are dedicated to <a title="Recyle" href="http://freegeektwincities.dreamhosters.com/about-2/recycle/">recycling</a> those materials in a way that is both environmentally and socially friendly.
