<strong>Open every day except Monday Â and Tuesday from noon until 5pm.</strong>

Many of the items donated to Free Geek still have some use left, and getting these items back into use.

So Free Geek has a Thrift Store that contains Complete Systems (Monitor(CRT), CPU, Keyboard, Mouse) with Linux installed for about $40 (prices are based on a standard CPU Speed, Ram, Hard Drive, and other accessories). We also sell individual parts like RAM, Disk Drives, Video Cards, Displays, printers and what ever else that is donated.

Because we only work with what has been donated, we have no control over inventory, but it also means we sell these used items for prices that are well below retail.

This equipment has no warranty, but we do our best to make sure it is tested to work, and if a part fails we will do our best to replace it with a similar item (based on what we have on hand and Free Geeks staff judgement) within the first month of purchase. This is subject to change on an item by item basis, and while we want to make everybody happy, we are limited in what we can provide to what has been donated and on hand.

Stop in and check out what we have.
