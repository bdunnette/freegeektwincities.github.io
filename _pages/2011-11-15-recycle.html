<h2>What Happens to Your Computer When it’s Recycled?</h2>
Computers that are deemed obsolete or broken are demanufactured and separated into their basic components by volunteers. Free Geek then finds a local industrial recycler to process the materials - one that we are confident will handle the materials in an environmentally responsible manner.
<ul>
	<li>Obsolete monitors and terminals are processed by Recycle America</li>
	<li>Aluminum, motors, wires and cables, printers, optical drives, speakers, and other copper bearing material are sold to best vendor available</li>
	<li>Circuit boards and processors are sold for precious metal recovery to Recycle America</li>
	<li>Plastic is sent to Recycle America</li>
	<li>Steel is sold to a recycler in the neighborhood</li>
</ul>
<h2>How We Choose Our Recyclers</h2>
Free Geek consistently works to make sure its industrial recyclers process e-waste in an environmentally responsible way. At times, we have turned down recyclers who’ve offered additional profit in order to uphold this value. We require the following of our e-waste vendors:
<ul>
	<li>Vendors may not ship overseas any material considered hazardous by <a href="http://ban.org/" target="_blank">The Basel Action Network</a>. All processing of these materials must occur in North America.</li>
	<li>Vendors may not send to the landfill material that could be recycled. Some material may be landfilled if there is no recycling process available, or if the only alternative would be burning it for fuel, which is less desirable than landfilling.</li>
	<li>Vendors may not use prison labor in any part of their process.</li>
	<li>Vendors are allowed to ship out of the country only material that is considered a commodity, as in clean steel, plastic, or copper.</li>
	<li>Vendors must be open to an audit of their processes, or provide results from a recent audit.</li>
</ul>
