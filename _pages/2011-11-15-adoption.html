<h3>Earn a Computer</h3>
Volunteers are able to earn a free computer by participating in our "Adoption" program.

<h4>Computer Adoption Program</h4>
This program aims to teach the volunteer some basic computer skills, by performing such tasks as computer disassembly or some basic testing of hardware like keyboards; you can also opt to build and test entire systems, depending on your level of expertise and what you'd like to learn.

After 24 hours of volunteering, you can take home one of our refurbished computers, complete with <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu GNU/Linux</a> and <a href="http://openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a>!
