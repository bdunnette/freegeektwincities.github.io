We have many fantastic volunteers at Free Geek, but a few make a long term commitment to help drive and build the organization into the future.   These individuals make long term commitments to the organization with their time and leadership, and are the core of Free Geek Twin Cities.

Free Geek Twin Cities is a 100% volunteer run organization, that means that nobody is paid, and funds gained by the organization can go towards our goals.  We do hope to have some paid staff at a future date, but only when the economics of our organization can justify them.

&nbsp;

We also have a group of volunteers we call Super Volunteers, they are individuals who in it for the long term.  They can be Mentors, Technical experts, or just willing to learn, share and do what it takes to run this organization.
