One of the missions of Free Geek is to Recycle technology, and the best way to do that is find a new home for equipment that has been donated.

To this end, we are looking for non-profits that need a basic computer or several for their organization.   These are basic systems, that are capable of Word Processing, Spreadsheets, Presentations, Web research, and the like.   We have installed Ubuntu on these systems, and the Open Source software to perform these tasks are there and ready to be used.

Plus there are other Open Source programs for things like Accounting, Customer Relationship Management, Education, Marketing and almost anything else you could need.

To submit a request for equipment we will need some basic information, like who your organization is, what you need, what you plan to use the equipment to do, etc.   We then review the request and compare it to what we have available.  We may not be able to meet every request, but we are strongly committed to getting systems back to doing some good while they still have the specifications to do just that.
