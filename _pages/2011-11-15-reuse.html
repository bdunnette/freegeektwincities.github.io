While Free Geek certainly recycles a several tons of electronics each year, our primary focus is getting the donated technology reused. At the heart of Free Geek’s mission is the <a href="http://freegeektwincities.org/volunteer/build/">Build Program</a>, where donated computers are lovingly refurbished into working machines running the<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu">Ubuntu Linux</a> operating system. These computers are then earned by volunteers, donated to non-profit organizations, or sold in the <a href="http://freegeektwincities.org/about/thrift-store/">Thrift Store</a>.

Free Geek volunteers not only refurbish desktop computers, but also work with laptops, Macs, motherboards, network devices, optical drives, cards, RAM, and exciting related components.
